At the time of transfer as per IRWO transfer policies all necessary undertakings were submitted by transferor and transferee including the affidavit signed by the transferor regarding any refund which may be there after closing of account books related to this property shall be paid to the transferee. But now IRWO has send a cheque of refund amounting Rs. 30000 at my address, but cheque is on the name of first allottee/ transferor. When I insisted them to issue the refund cheque on my name, they say it's according to rules, to be returned to the transferor. Who had actually paid the full amount to IRWO initially. So, plz clarify whether, who legally should get the refund cheque now. I have CTC copies of all such undertakings and affidavits deposited at the time of transfer at IRWO office.",

      "Reduce monthly maintenance amount after mutual consent divorce",
      "My divorce happened in May 2015, started with contested and ended up with mutual consent. My ex-wife had put all kinds of DV and Dowry cases on me and my parents in 2014, even though we were living separated since 2009. Anyways, the divorce happened in May 2015 and the monthly maintenance was settled for 55k, with an increase of 5k every alternate year, so its 60k now. Unfortunately, I do not have means to support this money, and am already in debt and am not able to pay my EMIs also to bank which I had taken for business loan (to start new work last year) and personal loan (to give her monthly maintenance). Unfortunately the new work hasnt kicked off and Im in grave financial debt. I married again in Dec 2016 and she has been supporting me financially and running the house, but kindly suggest, how can I reduce my monthly maintenance of 60k to atleast half, as the situation is very bad and its not correct to put this financial strain on my wife.",
      "That in case facts changed the maintenance amount can be altered. for doing so you have to approach the Court with changed circumstances but with proof what you are alleging. The court will consider the same and you will get the relief."
