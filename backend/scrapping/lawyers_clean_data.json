        "answer": "Reply to your query:-At the outset contradictory statement that you had purchased a flat on loan from ICICI Bank, but being abroad could not get a loan.Your brother applied for loan(nothing clear hence, home loan) on behalf of you by putting his name first as he applied loan (actually on your behalf)   which was duly sanctioned and your daddy's name.You have total 2 brothers (in other words your father having 3 sons)-you have not mentioned that whether you were re-reimbursing the entire loan installments amount to(monthly EMI) to your brother.,monthly basis or not.Bank is not aware about your internal arrangements of funds so bank is right that bring NOC from all the sons/legal heirs /representatives of your father..Your brother can not transfer the flat in your name since your father name also been inserted hence, even though it is your flat purchased on behalf of you by your brother, the NOC procedure must.You have to provide documentary/monetary evidence that although your brother name is in sale-deed and also in share certificate it is your money only and you are buyer of the flat, It is undisputed fact that you have to pay entire amount of loan+ interest and bank charges + out of pocket expenses+ registration fees etc to  your brother.whether have made any MOU or understanding documents/ affidavit/ whether power of attorney made by you to your brother. relinquishment deed to be prepare for giving away/surrendering his right since on paper your brother is owner(co-owner).Even your brother NOC is must and for that you need to pay all his dues first with MOU that once he receive entire amount he will be binding to issue NOC to you.Without NOC share certificate will not be in your name.+ you need to make one gift deed your father giving his right/ share in the said flat to you in your name.- hidden part since your father name is also mentioned in share certificate. -Father gift to son nominal expenses. Try to finish the procedure as soon as possible if any thing adverse / against you then you may face litigation as bank and society knows your brother and your father as shareholder.

        "details": "Hi My Husband owns a joined flat with my mother in law. The loan has been paid off completely by my Husband and we have received the documents from the bank. Pls advise the process required to delete my Mother in law’s name as the co-owner from the agreement. What would be the approx charges required? Also at the same time, can my name be added simultaneously while deleting hers. She is willing to sign the no objection documents. Pls advise.",
        "answer": "Hi,There are a number of ways in which your aim could be achieve. First option, you get an NOC from the society afterthat you can do the easiest way to remove your Mother in law’s name from the joint names as the co-owner from the agreement. if you do execute a release deed or relinquishment deed in favour of your name. Your Mother in law’s name as the first party execute the release or relinquishment deed in favour of you the second party and the document should be properly stamped and registered in jurisdictional sub-registrar office .In the alternative option your Mother in law’s can execute gift deed in your favour. it would attract 2% stamp duty on market value of property as per Ready Reckoner rates. The process, amount of stamp duty or taxes will depend upon the State where the property is situated. You will not have to worry as the gift deed is the safe and less expensive in terms of stamp duty.Thus from a stamp duty perspective, it is advisable to execute a gift deed rather than a release deed or relinquishment deed and the option you choose out of the two given here. You can consult a property lawyer on your states or contact us for further process...Thnaks & Regards,Vivek srivastava"

That loan is a separate matter at the discretion of bank subsequently you can add name of your brother also in bank record after transfer of property. But before doing the same you need to see whether any person from Bank is necessary since you cannot change ownership without permission of Bank or clearance of loan. That Just by making a agreement relating to the ownership and payment of instalment will not solve the issue as your brother will not be having anything in his name."

        "question": "Reduce monthly maintenance amount after mutual consent divorce",
        "details": "My divorce happened in May 2015, started with contested and ended up with mutual consent. My ex-wife had put all kinds of DV and Dowry cases on me and my parents in 2014, even though we were living separated since 2009. Anyways, the divorce happened in May 2015 and the monthly maintenance was settled for 55k, with an increase of 5k every alternate year, so its 60k now. Unfortunately, I do not have means to support this money, and am already in debt and am not able to pay my EMIs also to bank which I had taken for business loan (to start new work last year) and personal loan (to give her monthly maintenance). Unfortunately the new work hasnt kicked off and Im in grave financial debt. I married again in Dec 2016 and she has been supporting me financially and running the house, but kindly suggest, how can I reduce my monthly maintenance of 60k to atleast half, as the situation is very bad and its not correct to put this financial strain on my wife.",
        "answer": "That in case facts changed the maintenance amount can be altered. for doing so you have to approach the Court with changed circumstances but with proof what you are alleging. The court will consider the same and you will get the relief."

We have not had sexual intercourse in the last four months. After our engagement, we faced several issues with them and tried to cancel the marriage, but they didn't allow it. Now, if I am tested positive for impotency, what will be my fate? My parents insisted on the marriage, and that's all I have done. I come from a poor family but have a good job, while my wife is from an upper-middle-class background. She is asking for a divorce. Our marriage is now four months old. Please give me suggestions. Both of us are Hindus, and the claim of impotency is being used as a ground for divorce.",
        "answer": "Your wife can sue for divorce on the basis of impotency. But if you object to it in the court of law, they have to prove it by taking steps. For that you may need to undergo medical examination. If the impotency is proved then the divorce can be allowed. But impotency is of several reasons. Physical impotency is to be proved. A person may suffer from impotency due to mental elements; and that is temporary which can be cured. In that case we can stick on."

This is the basic jurisprudence of the fair constitutional rights all over the world and are, thus, part of the basic fundamental rights under our constitution. In criminal cases (except certain exceptions) the liability or onus to establish the guilt of the accused offender lies on the prosecution. Moreover, any statement made by the accused to the police during investigation in police custody (except in certain exceptions) are not admissible against the accused at trial. Having replied to your concerns I’ll suggest you should not jump to any conclusion(s) or commit yourself to any further action unless I get to examine the precise allegations, evaluate material and draw strategy to deal with the same. We can meet for a conference as per mutual convenience after prior scheduling. Plz bring aling all the case documents available with u. Best wishes,Gaurave BhargavaAdvocate"

It is going from court to court on appeal and now the tenant is going to Supreme Court i New Delhi (he lost in the Chennai High Court). Any idea how long it will take to get the judgement. If the tenant loses in Supreme Court can he appeal to any other higher bench?",
        "answer": "A case in Supreme Court may take anywhere between 5-7 years or more to get decided if ‘Notice’ is issued in the first hearing. It is, thus, advisable to keep track of the matter through a lawyer, file caveat, if advised by the lawyer & try to get the matter dismissed/rejected in the first hearing itself. After rejected by SC, the tenant has the option of filing a review petition & curative petition in SC itself, but chances of getting relief after initial dismissal of the case are negligible."
