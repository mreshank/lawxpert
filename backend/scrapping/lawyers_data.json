Sometimes he send messeges at even in mid night 4am. Sometimes he calls at 5am and disturbs me. Always I see he writes I love you, good morning etc. My mother and my cousin also warned him not to text anything. But still he text me. I am irritated. He is from puri orissa.

        "My wife and her parents are trying to sue me, claiming I am impotent. I personally do not have any health issues, but I didn't undergo any medical check-up prior to marriage. We have not had sexual intercourse in the last four months. After our engagement, we faced several issues with them and tried to cancel the marriage, but they didn't allow it. Now, if I am tested positive for impotency, what will be my fate? My parents insisted on the marriage, and that's all I have done. I come from a poor family but have a good job, while my wife is from an upper-middle-class background. She is asking for a divorce. Our marriage is now four months old. Please give me suggestions. Both of us are Hindus, and the claim of impotency is being used as a ground for divorce.",
        "Your wife can sue for divorce on the basis of impotency. But if you object to it in the court of law, they have to prove it by taking steps. For that you may need to undergo medical examination. If the impotency is proved then the divorce can be allowed. But impotency is of several reasons. Physical impotency is to be proved. A person may suffer from impotency due to mental elements; and that is temporary which can be cured. In that case we can stick on."

Either man or woman is dose not response on their sexual relation then can file for divorce. the frequency of sex cannot be the only parameter to assess the success or failure of a marriage as it differs from couple to couple as to how much importance they attach to the sexual relationship vis-a-vis the emotional attachment.There may be cases where one partner may be overtly sexual and the other may not have the desire to the same level, but otherwise is fully potent, the court observed. The high court said in matrimonial cases, more often than not it is a challenging task to ascertain as to which party is telling the truth as usually it is the oral evidence of one party against that of the other. What happens within the bedroom is either known to the couple themselves or at the most to the members of the family."

I sent copies by post to the SSP, Human Rights Delhi MLA, Chief Minister of Punjab, Women's Cell, and the High Court judge. The accused obtained signatures on a Panchayati Rajinama with three witnesses from each side. We were coerced into signing these papers under severe threat, especially since the ASI involved had already lodged a false FIR against me. These influential individuals are obstructing police duty.

        "How can I file a complaint against an immigration firm for fraud in India?",
        "In 2009, after graduating from college and seeking employment, a friend introduced me to Guru Kirpa Enterprises, an immigration firm in Mohali, directed by Neena Sharma. I paid them 1.20 Lac for a Canada work permit, but soon realized they were fraudulent. Despite requesting a refund, they failed to return my money. My father, a small farmer, borrowed that money with interest. We didn't file an FIR then because they assured us of a refund and abruptly shut down their office. Coming from a poor family and desperate for a job, I didn't pursue legal action. Recently, I discovered online that the director, Neena Sharma, was arrested in 2012 for 39 cases of immigration fraud and cheating. Can I file an FIR against her now, after 9 years? Please advise on my options. Thank you.",
